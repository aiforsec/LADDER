Since then, the implant’s functionality has been improving and remarkable new features implemented, such as the ability to record audio surroundings via the microphone when an infected device is in a specified location; the stealing of WhatsApp messages via Accessibility Services; and the ability to connect an infected device to Wi-Fi networks controlled by cybercriminals.	1
Moreover, as we dived deeper into the investigation, we discovered several spyware tools for Windows that form an implant for exfiltrating sensitive data on a targeted machine.	1
The implant provides the ability to grab a lot of exfiltrated data, like call records, text messages, geolocation, surrounding audio, calendar events, and other memory information stored on the device.	1
After manual launch, it shows a fake welcome notification to the user:	1
At the same time, it hides an icon and starts background services to hide further actions from the user.	1
AndroidAlarmManager Uploading last recorded .amr audio	1
AndroidSystemService Audio recording	1
AndroidSystemQueues Location tracking with movement detection	1
ClearSystems GSM tracking (CID, LAC, PSC)	1
ClipService Clipboard stealing	1
AndroidFileManager Uploading all exfiltrated data	1
‘geofence’ – this command adds a specified location to the implant’s internal database and when it matches a device’s current location the malware triggers and begins to record surrounding audio.	1
”social” – this command that starts the ‘AndroidMDMSupport’ service – this allows the files of any other installed application to be grabbed.	1
‘wifi’ – this command creates a new Wi-Fi connection with specified configurations from the command and enable Wi-Fi if it is disabled.	1
This command is used to connect the victim to a Wi-Fi network controlled by the cybercriminals to perform traffic sniffing and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.	1
‘camera’ – this command records a video/capture a photo using the front-facing camera when someone next unlocks the device.	1
The Skygofree Trojan comes with a powerful array of spyware features, some unique — like turning on audio recording by geolocation and stealing private messages.	1
For example, it can track the location of a device it is installed on and turn on audio recording when the owner is in a certain place.	1
In practice, this means that attackers can start listening in on victims when, say, they enter the office or visit the CEO’s home.	1
Another interesting technique Skygofree employs is surreptitiously connecting an infected smartphone or tablet to a Wi-Fi network controlled by the attackers — even if the owner of the device has disabled all Wi-Fi connections on the device.	1
For example, the latest version of Android can automatically stop inactive processes to save battery power, but Skygofree is able to bypass this by periodically sending system notifications.	1
The malware can also monitor popular apps such as Facebook Messenger, Skype, Viber, and WhatsApp.	1
In the latter case, the developers again showed savvy — the Trojan reads WhatsApp messages through Accessibility Services.	1
It’s a kind of “digital eye” that reads what’s displayed on the screen, and in the case of Skygofree, it collects messages from WhatsApp.	1
Last but not least, Skygofree can secretly turn on the front-facing camera and take a shot when the user unlocks the device — one can only guess how the criminals will use these photos.	1
Skygofree can also to intercept calls, SMS messages, calendar entries, and other user data.	1
The malware is distributed through fake mobile operator websites, where Skygofree is disguised as an update to improve mobile Internet speed.	1
If a user swallows the bait and downloads the Trojan, it displays a notification that setup is supposedly in progress, conceals itself from the user, and requests further instructions from the command server.	1
Researchers have identified a powerful new Android malware strain called Skygofree capable of eavesdropping on WhatsApp messages, siphoning private data off phones and allowing adversaries to open reverse shell modules on targeted devices, giving attackers ultimate remote control.	1
“The implant’s functionality has been improving and remarkable new features implemented, such as the ability to record audio surroundings via the microphone when an infected device is in a specified location; the stealing of WhatsApp messages via Accessibility Services; and the ability to connect an infected device to Wi-Fi networks controlled by cybercriminals,” wrote researchers Nikita Buchka and Alexey Firsh in a technical breakdown of their research.	1
Kaspersky Lab said Skygofree victims were likely infected via malicious redirects or man-in-the-middle attacks driving users to landing pages that mimic mobile carrier web sites.	1
Researchers describe Skygofree  as a complex system capable of a wide range of spying, similar to Pegasus discovered in August 2016. Pegasus was part of a spy platform traced back to a cyber arms-dealing outfit in Israel known as the NSO Group.	1
Pegasus consisted of three Apple iOS zero days that were used to spy on a political dissident.	1
Kaspersky Lab researchers said Skygofree’s advanced spy features also included recording Skype conversations and the unique ability to capture WhatsApp end-to-end encrypted conversations via exploiting Android Accessibility Services designed to assist users with disabilities.	1
“The payload uses the Android Accessibility Service to get information directly from the displayed elements on the screen, so it waits for the targeted application to be launched and then parses all nodes to find text messages,” researchers wrote regarding capturing WhatsApp conversations.	1
“As a result of the long-term development process, there are multiple, exceptional capabilities: usage of multiple exploits for gaining root privileges, a complex payload structure, never-before-seen surveillance features such as recording surrounding audio in specified locations,” researchers wrote.	1
A newly discovered form of Android malware, called Skygofree, can record device audio, video, and photos, steal data from device memory, read geolocation data, and even steal WhatsApp messages.	1
Skygofree is dangerous, but it’s spreading using the same old methods: compromised websites.	1
Dubbed Skygofree, the total spyware package is capable of performing 48 different remote commands, including capturing photos and video, recording audio, automatically connecting to compromised Wi-Fi networks, reading WhatsApp messages, stealing data from the device’s memory, reading geolocation data, and more.	1
Skygofree is even capable of activating geofences that trigger audio recording once the infected device enters a certain area.	1
“Usage of multiple exploits for gaining root privileges, a complex payload structure, never-before-seen surveillance features such as recording surrounding audio in specified locations,” are all capabilities of the surveillance kit.	1
It also has built-in process protection to stop Android’s idle process killing feature (in Android 8.0 and above) from killing its various functions: Skygofree processes will tell Android that they’re updating, so they can’t be disabled.	1
Skygofree is definitely a complicated piece of malware, but it’s getting installed on Android devices using the same old tricks: It’s hosted on malicious websites designed to mimic legitimate ones.	1
Android spyware has advanced surveillance capabilities, including turning on the mic when the victim enters specific geolocations.	1
Dubbed Skygofree, due to the word being used in one of its domains, Kaseprsky said the malware has “multiple, exceptional capabilities: usage of multiple exploits for gaining root privileges, a complex payload structure, never-before-seen surveillance features such as recording surrounding audio in specified locations.”	1
The “social” command allows files from any other installed app to be captured.	1
The payload targeting WhatsApp messenger uses the Android Accessibility Service to grab WhatsApp text messages.	1
The Android implant has a camera command that is triggered to record video or capture a photo when the device is unlocked.	1
It includes other spyware capabilities such as grabbing call records, text messages, tracking location, snatching calendar events, recording surrounding audio and snagging other information stored on the device; there’s also a command to create a new Wi-Fi connection to connect to the attackers’ network.	1
There were even components “that form an entire spyware system for the Windows platform.” The malware modifies a registry key to enable “autostart.” The main module is for reverse shell.	1
One module is used to exfiltrate Skype call recordings, but other capabilities include keylogging, turning on the mic to record audio, capturing screenshots and exfiltrating data.	1
Victims are infected after being lured to visit specific malicious sites meant to look like those of mobile operators.	1
Once there, the target is infected with “sophisticated multi-stage spyware that gives attackers full remote control of the infected device.”	1
Recently, we discovered another Windows Trojan we named “DualToy” which side loads malicious or risky apps to both Android and iOS devices via a USB connection.	1
In addition to found in traditional Windows PC malware such as process injection, modifying browser settings, displaying advertisements et al, DualToy also performs the following activities on Android and iOS devices:	1
Downloads and installs Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and iTunes drivers for Windows	1
Uses existing pairing/authorization records on infected PCs to interact with Android and/or iOS devices via USB cable	1
Downloads Android apps and installs them on any connected Android devices in the background, where the apps are mostly Riskware or Adware	1
Copies native code to a connected Android device and directly executes it, and activates another custom to obtain root privilege and to download and install more Android apps in the background	1
Steals connected iOS device’s information including IMEI, IMSI, ICCID, serial number and phone number	1
Downloads an iOS app and installs it to connected iOS devices in the background; the app will ask for an Apple ID with password and send them to a server without user’s knowledge (just like AceDeceiver)	1
DualToy tries to reuse existing pairing records to directly interact with mobile devices in the background.	1
Almost all samples of DualToy are capable of infecting Android devices connected with the compromised Windows PC via USB cable.	1
Once loaded, the module will first download universal Windows ADB drivers from its C2 server (e.g., from http[:]//www.zaccl.com/tool/new_tool.zip) and install them.	1
Download and install apps	1
Once connected, it will fetch a list of URLs from the C2 server, download the apps, and install them on Android device in the background via the “adb.exe install” command.	1
Install and execute binary code	1
It will also connect with its C2 server, download more Android apps and install them in background through “pm install” command.	1
Download and install iTunes	1
As it does with Android devices, DualToy will check whether the iOS device was previously paired so that it can reuse existing pairing record (Figure 10).	1
Steal iOS device information	1
After successfully connecting with an iOS device, DualToy will collect device and system information, encrypt them and send to its C2 server.	1
In addition to collecting device information, DualToy also tries to download IPA file(s) from the C2 server and install them on the connected iOS device.	1
Note that, since the C2 traffic was HTTP instead of HTTPS, and the credential payload was just encrypted by DES with a fixed key, an attacker could sniff network traffic to capture the payload and steal the Apple ID and password in the payload.	1
Researchers have found a malware family called DualToy that infects Windows PCs and sideloads malware onto connected Android and iOS devices.	1
A Windows Trojan called DualToy has been discovered that can side load malicious apps onto Android and iOS devices via a USB connection from an infected computer.	1
Researchers from Palo Alto Networks said DualToy has been in existence since January 2015, and it originally was limited to installing unwanted apps and displaying mobile ads on Android devices.	1
About six months later, the Trojan morphed and began targeting iOS devices by installing a third-party App Store in hopes of nabbing iTunes usernames and passwords.	1
Researchers said once DualToy infects a Windows machine, it looks for the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and iTunes, and downloads drivers for both if they’re missing in order to infect mobile devices once connected.	1
“Although this attack vector’s capability can be further limited by additional mechanisms (e.g., ADB enabling, iOS sandbox) which make this threat not so severe, DualToy reminds us again how attackers can use USB sideloading against mobile devices and how malware can be spread between platforms,” Xiao wrote.	1
The HackingTeam’s RCS delivered its spyware from infected PCs and Macs to jailbroken iOS devices and BlackBerry phones,” Xiao said.	1
On iOS devices, DualToy installs a fake iOS App Store used to try to trick users into divulging their iTunes username and password.	1
Last but not least, all the overlay screens (injects) for the banks include two steps; first stealing the victim’s login credentials, then their credit card details.	1
At that time, Ginp was a simple SMS stealer whose purpose was only to send a copy of incoming and outgoing SMS messages to the C2 server.	1
The malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default SMS app through the abuse of the Accessibility Service.	1
Although early versions had some basic code and string obfuscation, protection of the third version of the malware was enhanced with the use of payload obfuscation.	1
The capabilities remained unchanged, but a new endpoint was added to the Trojan C2 allowing it to handle the generic card grabber overlay and specific target overlays (banking apps) separately.	1
The author has introduced the capability to grant the app the device admin permission.	1
When the malware is first started on the device it will begin by removing its icon from the app drawer, hiding from the end user.	1
In the second step it asks the victim for the Accessibility Service privilege as visible in following screenshot:	1
Once the user grants the requested Accessibility Service privilege, Ginp starts by granting itself additional permissions, such as (dynamic) permissions required in order to be able to send messages and make calls, without requiring any further action from the victim.	1
When done, the bot is functional and ready to receive commands and perform overlay attacks.	1
SEND_SMS Send an SMS from the bot to a specific number	1
NEW_URL Update the C2 URL	1
KILL Disable the bot	1
PING_DELAY Update interval between each ping request	1
CLEAN_IGNORE_PKG Empty list of overlayed apps	1
WRITE_INJECTS Update target list	1
READ_INJECTS Get current target list	1
START_ADMIN Request Device Admin privileges	1
ALL_SMS Get all SMS messages	1
DISABLE_ACCESSIBILITY Stop preventing user from disabling the accessibility service	1

GET_APPS Get installed applications	1
GET_CONTACTS Get contacts	1
SEND_BULK_SMS Send SMS to multiple numbers	1
INJECT_PACKAGE Add new overlay target	1
CALL_FORWARD Enable/disable call forwarding	1
START_PERMISSIONS Starts request for additional permissions(Accessibility privileges, battery optimizations bypass, dynamic permissions)	1
The most recent version of Ginp has the same capabilities as most other Android banking Trojans, such as the use of overlay attacks, SMS control and contact list harvesting.	1
Since Ginp is already using some code from the Anubis Trojan, it is quite likely that other, more advanced features from Anubis or other malware, such as a back-connect proxy, screen-streaming and RAT will also be added in the future.	1
Overlaying: Dynamic (local overlays obtained from the C2)	1
At the end of February the actors behind Ginp added screen capture capabilities to their Trojan.	1
It enables the bot to stream screenshots and send them to the C2 so that actors can see what is happening on the screen of the infected device.	1
Ginp uses the Accessibility Service to check which application runs is the foreground.	1
Something that makes Ginp special is that all of its overlay screens for banking apps are consist of multiple steps, first stealing the victim’s login credentials, then stealing the credit card details (to “validate” the user identity), as shown in the screenshots hereafter:	1
In a 5-month timespan, actor managed to create a Trojan from scratch which will presumably continue evolving offering new features such as keylogging, back-connect proxy or RAT capabilities.	1
Ginp mobile Trojan fakes incoming SMS messages	1
Having infiltrated a phone, most mobile banking Trojans try to gain access to SMS messages.	1
They do so to intercept one-time confirmation codes from banks.	1
Armed with such a code, the malware owners can make a payment or siphon off funds without the victim noticing.	1
At the same time, many mobile Trojans use text messages to infect more devices by sending the victim’s contacts a bad download link.	1
The Ginp malware, which we first detected last fall, can even create incoming texts on the victim’s phone that no one actually sent — and not only texts.	1
It sent all the victim’s contacts to its creators, intercepted text messages, stole bank card data, and overlaid banking apps with phishing windows.	1
For the latter, the malware exploited Accessibility, a set of Android features for users with visual impairments.	1
That is not uncommon; banking Trojans and many other types of malware use these features because through them they get visual access to everything on the screen and can even “tap” buttons or links — in effect, they can take charge of your phone completely.	1
For instance, the malware started using push notifications and pop-up messages to get the victim to open certain apps — those that it can overlay with phishing windows.	1
But if you look into the “suspicious transactions” before calling the bank, the malware overlays the banking app with a fake window and asks for your card details.	1
In early February, our Botnet Attack Tracking system detected another new feature in Ginp: the ability to create fake incoming texts.	1
The purpose is the same as before — to get the user to open an app — but now, the Trojan can generate SMS messages with any text and seemingly from any sender.	1
It started as a SMS stealer and rapidly evolved into one of the most advanced actors in the financial fraud landscape.	1
Specifically, our team discovered new Ginp overlay pages intended for overlay attacks on mobile devices residing on the malware’s command-and-control (C&C) servers (see Figure 2).	1
When Ginp starts running, it first obtains information from the victim’s device, such as the state of the device and the currently installed applications, and sends it to the server.	1
In most cases, the malware will prompt the victim to click on his or her banking application and then pop a fake overlay onto the screen.	1
One of the recent features added to Ginp is the ability to make it appear as if a legitimate SMS message is being received on a device.	1
The server sends a command called “INSERT_SMS,” which triggers the malware to effectively mimic the process of receiving a new SMS message.	1
An additional technique the malware uses is generating fake push notifications.	1
Fake SMS Push Notifications	1
It is used for faking an incoming SMS message or push notification from the victim’s bank.	1
A few months ago, Ginp developers introduced a new feature that allows the malware to block all push notifications from legitimate applications.	1
This is particularly helpful to attackers, as it can block notifications about the fraudulent transaction taking place, thus avoiding arousing suspicion from the victim.	1
Additionally, the content of the blocked notification is sent to the C&C server, allowing malware operators to steal second-factor authentication codes or collect social media and instant messaging notifications to spy on the target.	1
This feature allows attackers to exfiltrate valuable information that can enable them to circumvent security controls.	1
The RAT also allows malware operators to take control of and conduct transactions from the victim’s device, reducing the risk of being detected by security countermeasures.	1
These overlay pages are similar to the regular ones, but persist on the screen and keep reappearing.	1
This feature blocks the victim from using his or her phone, even after entering their credentials, until their device is released by the malware operator.	1
This feature creates advantages for the attacker by persuading a victim to enter and reveal credentials to unlock the phone, and preventing a victim from accessing a legitimate banking application, which may have security countermeasures.	1
Ginp malware was first discovered in 2019 and started as an SMS stealer.	1
The third version was enhanced with payload obfuscation, with the credit card grabber extended with Viber and Snapchat.	1
By the end of February 2020, the operators had added screen capture capabilities, and the malware code seemed to be borrowed from the Anubis trojan source code.	1
Notifications blockers service	1
RAT capabilities	1
Injections locker	1
The malware works by accessing the target device in the disguise of an authentic app.	1
As soon as the malware gains access to the device, it hides the app icon and asks for Accessibility Service permissions.	1
When the user grants permission, it automatically gets dynamic permissions.	1
Using these permissions, the malware can send messages, make calls and perform overlay attacks easily without alerting the user.	1
In June 2019, the Ginp malware appeared first on the Play Store as the Google Play Verificator app; initially, its main function was to steal SMS messages.	1
This time, according to ThreatFabric’s blog post, the malware could perform many other functions such as abusing Accessibility Service to become the default SMS app and performing overlay attacks.	1
Ginp Trojan Targets Android Banking App Users, Steals Login Credentials and Credit Card Details	1
Upon execution in a victim device, Ginp removes its icon from the app drawer before asking the user for Accessibility Service privilege.	1
Once it receives the said privilege, it grants itself additional permissions for sending messages and making calls.	1
Ginp is capable of sending or harvesting SMS messages based on received commands.	1
It can also request admin privileges, enable overlay attacks, update the command-and-control (C&C) URL, update the target list, set itself as the default SMS app, prevent the user from disabling Accessibility Services, get installed apps or contacts, enable call forwarding, and hide itself and prevent removal, among other capabilities.	1
Notably, Ginp can trick the victim into giving out login credentials and credit card details by claiming that these pieces of information are a prerequisite to validate user identity.	1
"In its first iteration, Ginp disguised itself as a ""Google Play Verificator"" app, primarily stealing SMS messages."	1
In August, it posed as fake “Adobe Flash Player” apps targeting credit card information.	1
The next version was enhanced with payload obfuscation and started targeting Snapchat and Viber users as well as specific banking apps.	1
The said version notably switched to a new overlay target list and predominantly went after banking app users.	1
Ginp’s use of deceptive overlay screens to steal login credentials and credit card details should prompt users to be more vigilant when installing apps on their devices.	1
FakeSpy is an information stealer used to steal SMS messages, send SMS messages, steal financial data, read account information and contact lists, steal application data, and do much more.	1
FakeSpy masquerades as legitimate postal service apps and transportation services in order to gain the users' trust.	1
Once installed, the application requests permissions so that it may control SMS messages and steal sensitive data on the device, as well as proliferate to other devices in the target device’s contact list.	1
FakeSpy is an information stealer that exfiltrates and sends SMS messages, steals financial and application data, reads account information and contact lists, and more.	1
The malware uses smishing, or SMS phishing, to infiltrate target devices, which is a technique that relies on social engineering.	1
The attackers send fake text messages to lure the victims to click on a malicious link.	1
Thus far, FakeSpy campaigns are characterized by SMS phishing (a.k.a.	1
Once the user clicks on the malicious link from the SMS message, the app asks them to approve installation from unknown resources.	1
READ_PHONE_STATE - Allows read-only access to the phone state, including the current cellular network information, the status of any ongoing calls, and a list of any PhoneAccounts registered on the device.	1
READ_SMS - Allows the application to read text messages.	1
RECEIVE_SMS - Allows the application to receive SMS messages.	1
WRITE_SMS - Allows the application to write to SMS messages stored on the device or SIM card, including y deleting messages.	1
SEND_SMS - Allows the application to send SMS messages.	1
INTERNET - Allows the application to open network sockets.	1
WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - Allows the application to write to external storage.	1
READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - Allows the application to read from external storage.	1
RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED - Allows the application to receive a broadcast after the system finishes booting.	1
GET_TASKS - Allows the application to get information about current or recently run tasks.	1
SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW - Allows the application to create windows shown on top of all other apps.	1
WAKE_LOCK - Allows the application to use PowerManager WakeLocks to keep the processor from sleeping or the screen from dimming.	1
ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE - Allows the application to access information about networks.	1
REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS - Whitelists the application to allow it to ignore battery optimizations.	1
READ_CONTACTS - Allows the application to read the user's contacts data.	1
Change SMS App: This sets permissions to intercept every SMS received on the device and send a copy of these messages to the C2 server.	1
Ignore Battery Optimization: This sets permissions to continue to operate at full capacity while the phone's screen is turned off and the phone locked.	1
The first function is used for contact information stealing: the function upCon steals all contacts in the contact list and their information.	1
The second stealing function is the onStartCommand, which steals infected device data and additional information.	1
Bank - Checks if there are any banking-related or cryptocurrency trading apps	1
npki - Checks if the folder named NPKI (National Public Key Infrastructure) might contain authentication certificates related to financial transactions	1
It sends a smishing message to the entire contact list of the infected device along with the malicious link to the FakeSpy installation page.	1
Another interesting feature in FakeSpy’s code is the collection of the device's IMEI (International Mobile Station Equipment Identity) number and all installed applications using the function upAppinfos.	1
It shows that the malware can detect whether it’s running in an emulated environment or a real mobile device, and can change its code pattern accordingly.	1
Another example of FakeSpy’s anti-emulation techniques is how it uses the getMachine function, which uses the TelephonyManager class to check for the deviceID, phone number, IMEI, and IMSI.	1
The function main uses a DES encryption algorithm to encode these addresses.	1
This mobile malware masquerades as legitimate, trusted postal service applications so that it can gain the users trust.	1
Once it has been installed, it requests permissions from the user so that it can steal sensitive data, manipulate SMS messages, and potentially infect contacts of the user.	1
The malware now targets more countries all over the world by masquerading as official post office and transportation services apps.	1
Spoofing legitimate mobile applications is a common cybercriminal modus that banks on their popularity and relies on their users’ trust to steal information or deliver payloads.	1
Case in point: a campaign we recently observed that uses SMS as an entry point to deliver an information stealer we called FakeSpy (Trend Micro detects this threat ANDROIDOS_FAKESPY.HRX).	1
FakeSpy is capable of stealing text messages, as well as account information, contacts, and call records stored in the infected device.	1
Would-be victims will first receive a mobile text message masquerading as a legitimate message from a Japanese logistics and transportation company urging recipients to click the link in the SMS, as shown in Figure 1.	1
When targeting Japanese users, it poses as apps for transportation, logistics, courier, and e-commerce companies, a mobile telecommunications service, and a clothing retailer.	1
Once launched, FakeSpy will start monitoring for text messages that the affected device receives.	1
These SMS messages are stolen and uploaded to the C&C server.	1
FakeSpy’s commands include adding contacts to the device, setting it to mute, resetting the device, stealing stored SMS messages and device information, and updating its own configurations.	1
Apart from information theft, FakeSpy can also check for banking-related applications installed in the device.	1
It abuses social media by writing the IP address on a Twitter profile whose handles are regularly modified.	1
When FakeSpy launches, it will access the Twitter page and parse its contents to retrieve the C&C IP address.	1
SMiShing is not a novel attack vector, but with social engineering, it can lure or compel victims into handing out personal or corporate data, or direct them to malware-hosting websites.	1
FakeSpy Android Malware Spread Via ‘Postal-Service’ Apps	1
The malware, which is disguised as legitimate global postal-service apps, steals SMS messages, financial data and more from the victims’ devices.	1
The attacker uses text messages as an initial infection vector, prompting the Android recipients to click on a malicious link, in a practice known as SMS phishing or “smishing.”	1
One example of a message used in the latest FakeSpy campaign is an alert from the postal service local to the region of the victim, informing them that the service tried to send a package, but the receiver was not at home, for instance.	1
Then, “the link directs them to a malicious web page, which prompts them to download an Android application package (APK),” according to a report on the campaign, by Ofir Almkias, mobile analyst with Cybereason.	1
That APK downloads an app that appears to be from the local region’s legitimate postal service—such as the United States Postal Service (USPS)–but actually executes FakeSpy, an infostealer that requests permissions to take over SMS messages and steal sensitive data on devices.	1
The malware, which has been a threat since 2017, also can access and use a target device’s contact list to infect other devices.	1
Disguising malware as a legitimate mobile app is a hallmark of Roaming Mantis.	1
During installation, researchers observed FakeSpy gaining access to numerous permissions, including the ability to: read, write, send and receive SMS messages; open network sockets and access the internet; write to external storage; read from internal storage; and access information about networks to which the device is connected, among others.	1
After installation, the app begins its “real malicious activity” by downloading a set of dynamic libraries from the libmsy.so file, which executes the packed mycode.jar file to load various insidious information-stealing capabilities into FakeSpy’s process onto the device, Almkias said.	1
Once FakeSpy is on the device, it steals all contacts in the device’s contact list and their information, as well as the infected device’s data.	1
It also asks to be the device’s default SMS app so the malware can spread to other devices.	1
“FakeSpy uses this view to redirect users to the original post office carrier webpage on launch of the application, continuing the deception,” he wrote in his report.	1
“This allows the application to appear legitimate, especially given these applications icons and user interface.”	1
FakeSpy Android Malware Disguised as Postal Service Messages	1
The operators behind an updated version of the FakeSpy malware are targeting Android devices using SMS phishing messages to spread the info stealer, according to the security firm Cybereason.	1
The SMS messages are designed to appear to come from legitimate postal and delivery services, including the U.S.	1
The information stealer is capable of exfiltrating data, including financial and contact details, from the device, according to the research report released Wednesday.	1
The attacks associated with the latest FakeSpy campaign start with malicious SMS messages, or smishing messages, which notify victims of an undelivered package, the report notes.	1
"""Once the user clicks on the malicious link, the app asks them to approve installation from unknown resources,"" according to the Cybereason report."	1
During the installation process, the FakeSpy malware asks for a number of permissions, including the ability to read the phone's network status; compose and send SMS texts; access contact and external storage; connect to the internet; and reboot the device, the Cybereason report notes.	1
This includes stealing the victim's device information, contact details and SMS messages as well as data from banking or cryptocurrency apps, the report notes.	1
The malware uses a mobile device feature called sendAll to send SMS messages to the victim's other contacts, which helps to spread the information stealer, according to the report.	1
The Cybereason researchers note that the malware comes with anti-emulator capability to help evade security tools.	1
"It shows that the malware can detect whether it’s running on an emulated environment or a real mobile device, and can change its code pattern accordingly,"" the report notes."	1
FakeSpy, which was first discovered by security researchers nearly three years ago, is a particularly nasty piece of malware designed to steal a user’s text messages, financial data, bank login information, app data, contact lists, and more.	1
The manner by which FakeSpy spreads is quite clever and begins with an SMS message that claims to be from a local post office.	1
It then provides a link users can click which directs them to download an app disguised as a legitimate postal service app.	1
Once installed on a device, the app will then send the fake text, along with the malicious link, to a user’s entire contact list.	1
Once an unsuspecting user downloads the fake app, the malware essentially has full access to a user’s device.	1
Among other things, it can read text messages, send text messages, access contact information, and read from external storage.	1
Beyond that, the app also makes a point to look for any banking or cryptocurrency-related apps so that it can steal login information.	1
This ransomware family is known for being hosted on arbitrary websites and circulated on online forums using various social engineering lures, including masquerading as popular apps, cracked games, or video players.	1
Instead, it blocks access to devices by displaying a screen that appears over every other window, such that the user can’t do anything else.	1
The “call” notification, among several categories of notifications that Android supports, which requires immediate user attention.	1
The malware connects the dots and uses these two components to create a special type of notification that triggers the ransom screen via the callback.	1
setCategory(“call”) – This means that the notification is built as a very important notification that needs special privilege.	1
setFullScreenIntent() – This API wires the notification to a GUI so that it pops up when the user taps on it.	1
As the code snippet shows, the malware overrides the onUserLeaveHint() callback function of Activity class.	1
The function onUserLeaveHint() is called whenever the malware screen is pushed to background, causing the in-call Activity to be automatically brought to the foreground.	1
This creates a chain of events that triggers the automatic pop-up of the ransomware screen without doing infinite redraw or posing as system window.	1
The knowledge graph below shows the various techniques this ransomware family has been seen using, including abusing the system alert window, abusing accessibility features, and, more recently, abusing notification services.	1
In fact, recent variants contain code forked from an open-source machine learning module used by developers to automatically resize and crop images based on screen size, a valuable function given the variety of Android devices.	1
On top of recreating ransomware behavior in ways we haven’t seen before, the Android malware variant uses a new obfuscation technique unique to the Android platform.	1
As is characteristic for obfuscated threats, the malware has encrypted binary code stored in the Assets folder:	1
Instead, it uses several new tricks to render the phone unusable, making it one of the most advanced mobile malware programs around.	1
Like its predecessors, MalLocker.B displays a ransom note that covers the entire screen of infected devices.	1
Everything underneath it cannot be seen or accessed, preventing victims from using their phones.	1
Specifically, MalLocker.B misuses Android’s notification services to create a call notification that displays the ransom note full screen.	1
It then overrides an Android function that moves activities to the background.	1
This is done to keep the ransom note in the foreground.	1
Uses a new obfuscation technique.	1
To help the ransomware avoid detection by security solutions, part of the ransomware’s code is encrypted and stored in a folder.	1
Includes code from an open-source machine-learning module.	1
The machine learning module automatically resizes and crops images based on screen size.	1
Cybercriminals typically hide it in video players, pirated versions of popular commercial apps, and cracked games, which they hawk in online forums and host on third-party websites.	1
The new variant caught our attention because it’s an advanced malware with unmistakable malicious characteristic and behavior and yet manages to evade many available protections, registering a low detection rate against security solutions.	0
In the course of further research, we found a number of related samples that point to a long-term development process.	0

The notification was intended to be used for system alerts or errors, but Android threats misused it to force the attacker-controlled UI to fully occupy the screen, blocking access to the device.	0
Firewalls should also be configured to block known bad websites that host malicious APKs.	0
The mobile ransomware, detected by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint as AndroidOS/MalLocker.B, is the latest variant of a ransomware family that’s been in the wild for a while but has been evolving non-stop.	0
For example, some strains of ransomware abuse accessibility features, a method that could easily alarm users because accessibility is a special permission that requires users to go through several screens and accept a warning that the app will be able to monitor activity via accessibility services.	0
It is interesting to see that the group has expanded their operation to other regions, such as the United States and Europe.	0
Whereas users often push notifications aside without a glance, they tend to read their incoming SMS messages sooner or later.	0
